We built the backend using NodeJS and Express, as well as using MongoDB to store our data.\r\n                    A RestAPI was developed to handle search queries as well as user authentication was also implemented. The front end was built using the ReactJS framework and was deployed with Heroku.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <a href={\"https://tapster-app.com\"}>Check it out here!</a>\r\n                <p style={{marginTop: \"10px\"}}>(Pictures Coming Soon)</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={\"ag\"}>\r\n                <h2 className={\"title-text\"}>Envoc Aggriculture App</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The Envoc Aggriculture App was a Junior level Software Project. Working on a team of four, the goal was to set up a fully functioning Asp.Net Core backend with a ReactJS web app alongside a React Native mobile app, once again for a client.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <strong>The Client: </strong>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Our client was the owner of a business that allowed customers to pick their own fresh produce directly from their farm fields. We communicated with the client at least once every two weeks to ensure they were kept satisfied and engaged during the development process. They wanted their customers to be able to streamline their experience by giving them the ability to\r\n                    purchase tickets online via a mobile application and web application. They expressed their needs for mandatory features such as viewing available farm fields and produce, and purchasing tickets for those fields online.

The backend construction consisted of setting up various controllers for the api which were each rigorously Unit Tested for proper functionality,\r\n                    implementing a MYSQL database connection via EF Core, as well as implementing EF Core Identity for Authentication and Authorization.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    The web app was built using ReactJS and gave the client's customers the ability to view in-depth information on each of the client's farm fields available, as well as purchase tickets through the use of PayPal. The users also had the ability to register for an account where their purchased tickets would be stored for future use.\r\n                    <br/><br/>\r\n                    Using React Native we developed a mobile app that gave our client's customers the ability to browse farm fields, login and register for an account, view previously purchased tickets, and purchase new tickets as well. Customers were then able to redeem a valid ticket using a QR code on their phone.\r\n                    <br/><br/>\r\n                    The project was then deployed for the client using Microsoft Azure.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Skills / Technologies used:\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Jira Project Management Software</li>\r\n                        <li>BitBucket Source Control</li>\r\n                        <li>ReactJS & Native</li>\r\n                        <li>Redux</li>\r\n                        <li>Asp.Net Core</li>\r\n                        <li>EF Core Framework</li>\r\n                        <li>EF Core Identity</li>\r\n                        <li>MySQL</li>\r\n                        <li>Microsoft Azure</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{marginTop: \"10px\"}}>(Pictures Coming Soon)</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={\"discord\"}>\r\n                <h2 className={\"title-text\"}>Discord Bot (.Net Core)</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    During spare time, I began the development of a discord bot that made various API calls from various websites and handled serializing and deserializing json data into C# Objects using the JSON.NET library and then posting the results in the specified discord channel.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    Some of the abilities included searching the YouTube API for a video based on a search query, retrieving high-score data for a specified Fortnite player or fetching the daily in-game Item Shop, and using Tenor's API to fetch Gifs.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <a href={\"https://https://github.com/darrylmunsch/DiscordBot\"}>GitHub Repo</a>\r\n                <p style={{marginTop: \"10px\"}}>(Pictures Coming Soon)</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Projects;\r\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { HashRouter, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport './App.css';\nimport Landing from \"./Components/Landing\";\nimport NavBar from \"./Components/NavBar\";\nimport ResumePage from \"./Components/Resume\";\nimport Projects from \"./Components/Projects\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n      <div className={\"App\"}>\n      <HashRouter basename={\"/\"}>\n          <NavBar/>\n          <Route exact path={\"/\"} component={Landing}/>\n          <Route exact path={\"/Resume\"} component={ResumePage}/>\n          <Route exact path={\"/Projects\"} component={Projects}/>\n      </HashRouter>\n      </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
